This project is a front-end User Interface (UI) for an E-Learning Platform, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It presents a clean and responsive layout to showcase online courses, allowing users to explore and enroll with a simple click. This version is focused on design and user interaction, ideal for integration into a full-stack application later.
